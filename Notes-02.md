  ## Quote 1: "As you move from IT being treated as a capital investment that happens periodically to a world where pricing is closely tied to efficient use of resources, it pays to understand what drives cloud pricing so you can build a strategy for optimizing it."
    - The reason I found this qoute so interesting is because you are looked at as a capital investment when starting out in IT, but after learning and improving your skills in the field you can come up with a way to save that money on capital investment when handling new hires under you.
    
    
   ## Quote 2: "If it were just about cost savings and scaling, using public clouds would be more expensive, in many instances."
    - The interesting part I found about this quote is the sheer amount of variety and optionscloud computing provides beyond simple cost investments.
